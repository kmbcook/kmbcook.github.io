  <h2>The Adventures of Kevin Cook</h2>
   <img src="img/kevin.jpg">
<p>
Welcome to the story of my adventures in graduate school. I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.

<p>
On Thursday June 4th of this year (2015) at about 11am while running multiple experiments simulating a team of UAVs tracking a ground target, my experiments all crashed together, and I soon realized that I could no longer log in to my computer. 

<p>
Shortly thereafter, I recieved a phone call from my advisor stating that the chair of the department wanted to speak with me. I was in deep trouble. My computer access to department computers had been suspended. As far as I know, it is still suspended. Amazingly, I am still in the program and am still able to progress towards my degree.

<p>
The reason for this unusual situation relates to a paper I wrote (last revised February 28th) and put on my home page as a working paper: A proof of the inconsistency of ZFC [<a href="doc/not-zfc.pdf">pdf</a>]. Since June 4th, I have not been able to access my home page: http://aml.cs.byu.edu/~kmbcook, and the page has not been publicly accessible. 

<p>
I actually really like my paper, even though it could certainly be improved. I would like to use the paper as a basis for teaching a course in mathematics.

<p>
My story would be incomplete without an account of the role that my faith in God has played, and continues to play. My faith is an integral part of my life and is especially relevant to this paper and the story behind it.

<p>
I am naturally a private person, so telling this story is not easy for me. On the other hand, I love learning and want to teach. So, I'll learn to share.
