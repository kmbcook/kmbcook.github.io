Hi and welcome to the home page of a BYU cougar. The end is near! (The end of a long and <a href="adventure.html">adventurous</a> process completing my PhD degree.) I anticipate defending my dissertation in April. 

<p>
One important task at hand is to get a job. I would like to teach and supervise student research. I am passionate about learning and look forward to contributing to university education. Particularly, I would like to teach a course in mathematics based on my ZFC paper (listed below). Please contact me at my gmail address: kevincook13.
