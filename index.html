  <h2>The Adventures of Kevin Cook</h2>
   <img src="img/kevin.jpg">
<p>
Welcome to the story of my adventures in graduate school. I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.

<p>
On Thursday June 4th of this year (2015) at about 11am while running multiple experiments simulating a team of UAVs tracking a ground target, my experiments all crashed together, and I soon realized that I could no longer log in to my computer. 

<p>
Shortly thereafter, I received a phone call from my advisor stating that the chair of the department wanted to speak with me. I was in deep trouble. My computer access to department computers had been suspended. As far as I know, it is still suspended. Amazingly, I am still in the program and am still able to progress towards my degree.

<p>
The reason for this unusual situation relates to a paper I wrote (last revised February 28th) and put on my home page as a working paper: A proof of the inconsistency of ZFC [<a href="doc/not-zfc.pdf">pdf</a>]. Since June 4th, I have not been able to access my home page: http://aml.cs.byu.edu/~kmbcook, and the page has not been publicly accessible. 

<p>
I actually really like my paper, even though it could certainly be improved. I would like to use the paper as a basis for teaching a course in mathematics.

<p>
My story would be incomplete without an account of the role that my faith in God has played, and continues to play. My faith is an integral part of my life and is especially relevant to this paper and the story behind it.

<p>
I am naturally a private person, so telling this story is not easy for me. On the other hand, I love learning and want to teach. So, I will learn to share.

<p>
My faith in God is fairly simple. I do believe God lives, that we are His children, and that He plays an active part in our lives whether we believe in Him or not. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

<p>
I also believe that God purposefully allows us the opportunity to choose whether we believe in Him or not. In other words, I believe He withholds from us enough evidence of Him that we may be tempted to choose not to believe the evidence He has given us.  

<p>
My faith is that I am obligated to serve God, not only because of the life and blessings He has given me but also because of the sacred covenant I have made to serve Him. This is a joyful obligation, in spite of the fact that it is sometimes very difficult.

<p>
In early 2007 and in answer to prayer regarding my future plans I felt directed to go to BYU. I had already graduated from that school years earlier in 1989. So I pursued it, was accepted and jumped in with both feet.

<p>
I have always known that God was interested in my life and what I was doing with it. But I also know that He has been particularly interested in my going back to school. During these years in graduate school I have often wondered why this experience is important to Him, and what He wants me to try to make of it.

<p>
One day in the NLP (natural language processing) lab early on I made an off-hand joke about evolution. I do not remember what I said, but the response surprised me. The response was that my lab partners did not think my joke was very funny. One of them said that the evidence that man evolved was overwhelming. I do not think I responded. I had no idea what to say. I thought it was obvious that the idea that man was created by chance was silly, especially to such a faithful group of people who understood probability as well as they did.

<p>
I do understand that what I am writing seems utterly ridiculous to many. My intent is certainly not to ridicule the beliefs of others. I am just being frank about my experience.  

<p>
That experience had a profound impact on me. I began to think about what I might be able to do to help correct what I saw as a serious problem. 

<p>
Much later I was yet again surprised by my young friends. This time it was about probability. A PhD student for whom I have great respect kindly explained to me something I should have already known about a prevailing current belief in probability theory. To me, the belief was obviously contradictory. I was amazed that he accepted it. 

<p>
Again, I began to think about what I might be able to do. I became very interested in finding what might be the root cause of what appeared to me to be a contradictory belief. My paper, mentioned at the beginning of this story, is a result of that search. 

<p>
I have submitted the paper for publication. It was rejected without review. The reason given was that I made a certain assumption which invalidated my argument.
 I would like to discuss that issue in detail, but not now.

<p>
At that point I had a decision to make. I could submit to another journal, but would likely run into the same type of roadblock. I figured that the paper would probably not be published until a large number of mathematicians understood and accepted it. I decided to personally contact authorities in mathematics and ask them to look at my paper. It was my contacting people by email which eventually led to the response by my department.

<p>
I believe that my paper will be understood and accepted. The reason for that belief is my faith in God. God has led me to pursue this paper, and even helped me to write it. He has power to work miracles.  

<p>
It is not unusual for me to be led and helped by God in all aspects of my life. This is normal for me, even though I make plenty of mistakes and am definitely a work in progress. I know that such a life is normal for many people who choose to put their faith and trust in God.  

<p>
One thing I am learning in graduate school is how much faith people put in the academic process. I am invested in that process and have already benefited greatly from it. The basic process of reading what others have published, learning, writing, receiving feedback, re-writing, and publishing is a proven vehicle for discovering knowledge.

<p>
The academic process and its authorities have attracted a great deal of recognition and support. Along with that success comes the temptation to act selfishly, of course. 

<p>
Some believe that everyone acts selfishly and that our world progresses on the principle of self-interest. Through my faith I learn that the success and prosperity of the world is upheld by devoted and unselfish service. I aspire to act unselfishly. In order for authorities to avoid the natural tendency to be self-serving it is necessary for them to self discipline, which can be uncomfortable and therefore neglected.

<p>
I have personal experience with academic authorities refusing to self discipline. I therefore appeal to those who provide recognition and support. Please hold these authorities accountable. Please request that they disclose information regarding their treatment of me as it pertains to this paper. Please request that they disclose the names and communications of those who opposed my paper being publicly accessible from my BYU academic home page.

<p>
Why hide? If you are interested in the truth and in teaching the truth then come out in the open. Say who you are and how you think the quest for truth benefited from your actions.

<p>
Who am I? Certainly flawed, but a person who wants to be good and do good in the world. 

<p>
I was born in England. My father is English and my mother American, Croatian by lineage. I was raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I have one brother and one sister. I am the oldest and we are about seven years apart.

<p>
While I was growing up we lived in four different homes, Lawndale, Curdes, Parker Drive, and Ravinia. My favorite was the home on Parker Drive. Parker Drive was a long winding gravel road alongside a river. Our home was on about 4 acres, with a barn and two Shetland ponies. The area for the ponies was surrounded by an electric fence.

<p>
My brother Colin and I had the basement to ourselves. It was mostly one large room with a hard concrete floor. One of my favorite memories was making little bomb shelters out of legos, taking them to the top of the basement stairs and then throwing them to the basement floor. The objective was to see if we could build a structure which could withstand the impact.

<p>
We lived in a kids paradise. I doubt that it was a parents paradise. I remember an extended period of time when the well didn't work. During that time we drove to a nearby business to fill large containers with water.   

<p>
During the blizzard of '78 the city shut down for three days. School shut down for a week. I decided to use that time to hone my fire-making skills.  

<p>
My church sponsored a Boy Scout troop. We went on a 50-mile afoot afloat adventure. We canoed for days, drinking in the beauty of the river and engaging the other canoes in battle. At night I was eaten alive by mosquitoes, but that discomfort didn't begin to dampen my enthusiasm.

<p>
One family vacation we stayed for a week in an old cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky. Before we could use the cabin, spider webs and other traces of animals had to be cleaned out. Mom brought beautiful quilts from home for the beds and cooked on an old wood stove in the center of the cabin.

<p>
I played endless board games with Dad. The aim of my existence that week was to beat him, but I never did. At one point I broke down and cried after losing a game I had so hoped to win. He didn't like seeing me hurt and asked if he should let me win. I choked down my tears and said something like "No Dad, it's OK. I don't want you to let me win."

<p>
I delivered newspapers to a nearby apartment complex. I enjoyed delivering the papers. It was good exercise and I felt good about learning to work. I didn't like collecting money from my customers. I collected enough to pay my bill to the newspaper company and a little extra for myself, but there were many people who got a free newspaper.

<p>
I attended early morning seminary which helped me to learn and appreciate the scriptures. I felt the love and faith of my teachers, and I grew to love them.

<p>
I played the trumpet in jazz and marching bands. We traveled to Daytona Beach in Florida. The rising sun on the ocean was spectacular.

<p>
I remember my teachers Mr. Bates, Mrs. Zinc, Mr. Wittenberg, Mr. Dvorak, Mr. Ashton and Mrs. Thomson. They instilled within me a love for learning and a confidence in my ability to succeed in life. 

<p>
I did enjoy high school, but when I finished I felt free. Free to pursue a life of challenge and achievement.

<p>
Both of my parents had gone to BYU. That's how they met. It made perfect sense. I'd go to BYU too, find a beautiful girl, and marry in the temple for time and all eternity. I'd be a dad, gain experience, and learn to become like my Heavenly Father. So off I went, across the country to a parched land with no trees, no mosquitoes, and beckoning mountains.

<p>
It was difficult to be a responsible adult. I was just starting out, and learning important lessons through hard experience. Surprisingly, my grades were only average. More was being expected of me, and I began to realize that I had wasted opportunity in high school due to my poor attitude toward studying.  

<p>
I found some awesome friends. We had a great time together.

<p>
I received my patriarcal blessing from Clyde Sandgren, which inspired me with a powerful vision of what I could become by following the gospel plan.

<p>
My boyish heart was broken. My friends patiently listened. Time helped cheer me up.

<p>
At the end of the academic year, it was time to return home to Indiana. The first order of business was to earn money for a mission. I got hired by a landscaping company, but couldn't actually work for the first two weeks due to heavy rain. But I was determined to work. So I decided to start a television repair business, to pursue when I wasn't landscaping.

<p>
Mostly I just replaced worn out vacuum tubes, but there were other problems. One in particular stumped me. The main fuse was blown. After replacing it, the new fuse blew immediately. I had no training in electronics, and no idea what I was doing, so I decided to wrap the blown fuse in tin foil. KA-POW! That was exciting, and distressing. Obviously there had been something else wrong, causing the fuse to blow. Unfortunately, the TV was now dead as a doornail.

<p>
After a year and a half I didn't have much money for a mission. I had some expensive TV repair equipment, which I planned to use afterwards. My father realized what was happening and decided to charge me a little each month for rent. Without saying anything, he saved that money for me. When it was time to serve the Lord as a missionary, my dad let me know what he had done. I would have enough.

<p>
I received a call to serve in the Germany Hamburg mission. As part of my preparation I returned to Utah and received my endowment in the Salt Lake temple. 

<p>
My mission transformed my life. That miracle unfolded through service, service to the Lord and to my neighbor. It was a difficult form of service, difficult to give because it wasn't welcomed. I became a new person because of it, less selfish and more dedicated to the Lord. 

<p>
Rather than share details of my mission in Germany, I'd like to share a scripture. "And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!" (Doctrine and Covenants 18:15)

<p>
Following my mission I returned to BYU. I was a new person, but still far from perfect. I would describe this period of my life as a bit painful. I am grateful for the influence of friends from my mission who continued that friendship afterwards. One of those friends and I ran the Saint George marathon together. That was fun.

<p>
I was blessed to marry a bright beautiful girl, my best friend. Together, we were blessed with Devon, Joshua, Lauresa, Brian, Christopher, Adam, Amelia, Samuel, Alison, John, and Michelle. And the blessings continue to come as our children marry and have children of their own. Truly the windows of heaven have been opened and blessings poured out upon us.

<p>
While in school, I taught German at the missionary training center and took care of equipment in the electrical engineering shop.   

<p>
Around the time I graduated in computer and electrical engineering, I decided to venture off on my own. I wanted independence and adventure. There was so much I looked forward to doing and learning. I was brimming with enthusiasm and self-confidence.

<p>
One of my ambitions was to use computers to help people learn foreign languages, particularly to help with listening comprehension and pronunciation.

<p>
Most computers at the time lacked sound capabilities. For my senior project I designed and built a sound card together with amplified speaker and enclosure for the IBM PC. 

<p>
My plan was to start by repairing electronics, and then use my spare time to branch out into other areas, such as developing educational software and whatever else I wanted to do. So I set up shop in our apartment and went to work.

<p>
My business specialized in computer monitor repair. When a monitor stopped working, I would find the diode, capacitor, or other component that had failed and replace it. Often the problem was a bad solder joint. The cost in materials to fix a monitor was generally very low. The challenge was to quickly find the faulty component, or components. 

<p>
I learned that time was better spent when I actually understood how a circuit worked. I rarely had a schematic diagram to help. Rather, I studied the layout of the circuit board. This practice of learning how a circuit worked by studying the layout of the board was fairly practical since circuit boards were almost always single-sided.

<p>
 If I didn't find the root cause of a problem at first, I would need to go back and take a closer look until I found the culprit perpetuating the problem.  

<p>
My family was growing, my business was marginal, spare time was scarce, and money was tight. I began to realize my limitations. Instead of being buoyed up with anticipation for the future I began to be weighed down with failings of the past.  

<p>
Obviously, things weren't going as planned. At that time I had two small repair shops, one in Provo and the other in Auburn Washington. I thought it would be best to leave my business and join the growing software development market back in Utah.

<p>
Before making a final decision I counseled with the Lord through fasting and prayer. 

<p>
Earlier, before starting my business I had done the same. At that time I really wanted to start my own business and essentially asked the Lord for permission. The answer I received was that it would be fine with Him, as long I as lived righteously and kept His commandments. So, I enthusiastically started my business.

<p>
This time was very different. I asked for counsel regarding my plans to change course. The answer I received was that it would be better for me to stay with my business and discipline myself to run it effectively. I was counseled to pay closer attention to detail and to start work consistently by 8am.

<p>
So I stayed with my business and put my effort into doing a better job. 

<p>
I tried working more. I put more burden on my sweetheart at home. I was negligent fulfilling my responsibilities at church. As scoutmaster, I chose not to go with my troop to summer camp. Though, I did not work on Sunday. Finally, I realized that working too little was not the problem.  

<p>
I tried working smarter, and saw limited success. Gradually, I was doing a better job. 

<p>
And I was growing in other ways. I was asked to serve as scoutmaster again, this time back in Utah. Smarting from earlier poor choices, I decided to serve wholeheartedly and felt great about it. My troop helped build Discovery Park in Pleasant Grove.

<p>
But in spite of improvements my business was a dead end. I could not find a way to get a decent return on the investment of time required to diagnose a failure. There were too many different failures. There were too few monitors with the same failure. And, the cost of a new monitor was steadily falling.  

<p>
I had tried many times to start work consistently by 8am, but had not actually done it. About seven years had passed, since I received that counsel from the Lord. I knew that starting work early was important, but did not think it was going to solve all my problems. 

<p>
One Sunday while sitting in church partaking of the sacrament I promised the Lord I would do what He had counseled me to do. I realized that I had been trying harder to do my best than to follow His counsel. During the next few years I wrestled to keep that promise, and eventually did. Keeping my promise to God meant everything to me.

<p>
I learned that it was more important for me to listen to my Heavenly Father than to succeed, more important even than to succeed in doing something good. I realized that by choosing to follow His counsel I had embarked on a spiritual journey to a land which could only be reached with His continued help and direction.

<p>
From the moment I made that promise I was filled with a profound sense of peace and happiness. The Spirit of the Lord whispered to my soul that God was pleased.  

<p>
While fixing monitors I didn't have any free time on my hands, not free time for my hands. My hands were always busy. There were things to take apart, to put back together, to solder, and to un-solder. 

<p>
But my mind had free time. The challenge was how to take advantage of that opportunity. I wanted to learn Java. I figured that I needed to read the language specification. There were other things I also needed to read, such as the scriptures and teachings of the presidents of the church.

<p>
So I wrote a program to read these things to me aloud, while I worked.

<p>
My mind had free time, but that time was frequently interrupted. The phone would ring. A customer would come in. I would finish what I was doing. Another challenge was understanding the output of text-to-speech software. Some words were pronounced incorrectly. The output was unnatural, lacking the natural flow of speech which helps the listener understand. 

<p>
So I wrote the program to read aloud only one line of text at a time, then wait for input from me. That way, I could take a phone call, help a customer, or think about what needed to be done without having to pause the computer. Also, if I had trouble understanding what was said, I could easily have the computer say it again. 

<p>
I came to really like the fact that the computer waited for input before continuing. Perhaps what I liked most was that I could easily think about what I had just heard. My pondering was not interrupted by the computer. Reading continued only when I was ready. Reading by listening in this way was more like regular reading, which only continued when I took initiative by moving my eyes to the next line of text.

<p>
I had the idea that the program I had written for reading could be modified to act as an audio computer interface, enabling a person to use a computer without a visual interface. I thought an audio interface might be useful to people who were driving or otherwise unable to look at a visual interface. I loved to hike and think. Perhaps I would enjoy having computer access without the necessity of stopping to look at a screen, or trying to view a screen while walking. 

<p>
I realized that a simple touch-tone telephone had the necessary electronics to implement a basic audio interface: a network connection, a speaker, and some buttons. And it had a microphone.  

<p>
I decided to pursue my audio interface idea by building a prototype. I figured that writing the necessary software would either help me start a new business or help me start a new career.  

<p>
So I built a prototype using a Dialogic telephone interface computer expansion board. The basic functionality was that a user could peruse a set of choices by going forward and backward through a list of audio messages, and then initiate an action by selecting the desired choice. The telephone keypad acted essentially as a computer mouse, and the telephone speaker acted as the display. 

<p>
A friend helped me find a market for the invention, which I pursued. A local movie theater decided to use the system, dubbed Keypad Browser, to announce movie showtimes over the phone. The system allowed users to quickly find showtimes they wanted to hear rather than having to wade through one long message. My dad and brother-in-law encouraged me to file a patent. I wrote it, and my dad paid the filing fee. 

<p>
At this point my monitor repair business had dried up. I took some odd jobs, including delivering newspapers with the help of my oldest children. My brother offered me a job at a computer hardware startup which was being acquired by Avocent, and I took it gratefully. Cinemark, a movie theater chain, expressed interest in my product and asked me to send them one for a new theater opening in American Fork.

<p>
During the next two years I got a taste of working for a large business, which I thoroughly enjoyed after being on my own for so many years. It was great to work together as a team to try to bring a product to market. My ability to diagnose difficult problems came in handy several times. 

<p>
During that same period, Cinemark bought many of my movie showtime announcement systems, and I successfully defended my patent claims with the help of a law firm.

<p>
Suzanne and I focused on paying off debts. We felt extremely blessed. We had just finished paying off everything except the mortgage when news came that my employer was shutting down its branch in Utah. 

<p>
Our house was small and brimming with children. We had a large back yard for kids to play and Mom to garden. We grew tomatoes, peppers, green beans, corn, onions, raspberries, apples, peaches, and a few potatoes. We tried to grow apricots and pears, but without much success. Each fall we canned enough salsa to last a year, around 60 quarts. We also made our own bread, as much as 16 loaves every two weeks from freshly ground whole wheat.

<p>
There were plenty of opportunities to develop Christ-like attributes, such as patience and brotherly kindness, especially with seven brothers in the house! We shared one bathroom.

<p>
In the winter I split logs for the wood stove. It was big and put out a lot of heat. The house was poorly insulated. The wood stove helped keep down the heating bill and made at least one room very warm. The light from the fire cheered Mom's spirits when winter gloom blocked out the sun for extended periods.

<p>
Mom instilled a love for reading and music in each child. She regularly took them to the library and read to them. She kept an eye open for a good used book at the local thrift store. We limited time for media in our home so that there would be plenty of time for homework, reading, singing, and visiting together. She taught each of our children to play the piano. The sound of music filled our home. 

<p>
Mom cut everyone's hair, except her own. 

<p>
After a long day of hard work, Mom would settle down and enjoy reading for herself. We loved her, and she loved us. We tried to be good and helpful so she would not follow through on her repeated threat to run away to Mexico.

<p>
My wife helped me to see that I needed to change the way I treated my oldest son. The Spirit of the Lord softened my heart and helped me humble myself sufficient to listen and understand the truth of what she said. 

<p>
With the completion of my work at Avocent came a career decision. I enjoyed my work there, but I was not excited about pursuing a similar type of work with some other company. I felt I needed to pay attention to my career, not just to getting another job.

<p>
I was inspired by the thought of people benefiting from the system for reading by listening which I had discovered. My Keypad Browser audio computer interface technology could help provide such a benefit. Up to this point in time, the technology was merely being used to provide efficient telephone access to movie showtimes. Its full potential had not yet been realized.
