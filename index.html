  <h2>The Adventures of Kevin Cook</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the story of my adventures in graduate school. I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.

<p>
On Thursday June 4th of this year (2015) at about 11am while running multiple experiments simulating a team of UAVs tracking a ground target, my experiments all crashed together, and I soon realized that I could no longer log in to my computer. 

<p>
Shortly thereafter, I recieved a phone call from my advisor stating that the chair of the department wanted to speak with me. I was in deep trouble. My computer access to department computers had been suspended. As far as I know, it is still suspended. Amazingly, I am still in the program and am still able to progress towards my degree.

<p>
The reason for this unusual situation relates to a paper I wrote (last revised February 28th) and put on my home page as a working paper: A proof of the inconsistency of ZFC [<a href="doc/not-zfc.pdf">pdf</a>]. Since June 4th, I have not been able to access my home page: http://aml.cs.byu.edu/~kmbcook, and the page has not been publicly accessible. 

<p>
I actually really like my paper, even though it could certainly be improved. I would like to use the paper as a basis for teaching a course in mathematics.

<p>
I will tell more of this story as I can.
