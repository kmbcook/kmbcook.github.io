  <h2>Does 0.9 repeating equal one?</h2>

<p>
The number 0.9 does not equal one. And the number 0.99 does not equal one. No matter how many times we add another nine, the resulting number still does not equal one.

<p>
One might write 0.999... = 1. But such notation is confusing. The ellipses imply that the series of nines does not stop. If the series of nines does not stop, then it is not possible to get to the equals sign. 

<p>
Likewise, the question "Does 0.9 repeating equal one?" is confusing since the term "0.9 repeating" implies that the nines repeat without end, making it impossible to get to the word "equal" when trying to make sense of the question.

<p>
In order to make sense of the question, it is necessary to define the term "0.9 repeating". If we define the term to be equivalent to one, then yes it equals one. If we define the term as a variable which approaches one as nines are added, then no it does not equal one since it does not refer to a number.
