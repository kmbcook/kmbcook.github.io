  <h2>Does 0.9 repeating equal one?</h2>

<p>
The number 0.9 does not equal one. And the number 0.99 does not equal one. No matter how many times we add another nine, the resulting number still does not equal one.

<p>
One might write 0.999... = 1. But such notation is confusing. The ellipses imply that the series of nines does not stop. If the series of nines does not stop, then it is not possible to get to the equals sign. 

<p>
Likewise, the question "Does 0.9 repeating equal one?" is confusing since the term "0.9 repeating" implies that the nines repeat without end, making it impossible to get to the word "equal" when trying to make sense of the question.

<p>
In order to make sense of the question, it is necessary to define the term "0.9 repeating". If we define the term to be equivalent to one, then yes it equals one. If we define the term as a variable which approaches one as nines are added, then no it does not equal one since it does not refer to a number.

<p>
One might attempt to define the term as a zero followed by a decimal point followed by an infinite sequence of nines, not a sequence which is continually growing, but a static sequence which has no end. Such an attempt to define sets forth contradictory conditions which cannot be satisfied, and therefore fails to define because it fails to clarify the meaning of the term. Rather than clarify, the attempt to define confuses. 

<p>
A sequence which is continually growing is a variable which refers to different sequences at different times. We refer to the variable as a sequence, even though it is not a sequence. Rather it is a sequence variable, a variable which refers to one sequence at one time and possibly another sequence at another time.

<p>
In order to define a sequence it is necessary to define both the beginning and the end of the sequence. For example, suppose that the first element of a sequence is nine, the second element is nine, and likewise the third element is nine. Has the sequence been defined? Not yet. What has been defined is a class of sequences, the class of sequences which begin with three nines. If we additionally specify that the third element is the last element, then the sequence is defined. Once the sequence is defined we can interpret the sequence as a number, 999.

<p>
A sequence has an end. If a sequence does not have an end then it is not defined. If a sequence is not defined then it is not a sequence, even though we refer to it as a sequence. As mentioned earlier, we may refer to a sequence variable as a sequence. Likewise, we may refer to a class as a sequence. The sequence class is the class of things which are sequences. A class is not a sequence. A sequence that does not have an end is not a sequence. 
 
<p>
A sequence that does not grow or change is a static sequence. A static sequence is simply a sequence, and has an end.

<p>
The conditions of a sequence being static and not having an end are contradictory because a static sequence has an end.

<p>
A finite sequence is simply a sequence.

<p>
An infinite sequence does not have an end and is therefore not a sequence. An infinite sequence is a sequence variable.

<p>
A zero followed by a decimal point followed by an infinite sequence of nines is a sequence variable which can be interpreted as a number approaching one as nines are added.
