  <h2>The Adventures of Kevin Cook</h2>
   <img src="img/kevin.jpg">
<p>
Welcome to the story of my adventures in graduate school. I was a doctoral student in computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.

<p>
On Thursday June 4th 2015 at about 11am while running multiple experiments simulating a team of UAVs (drones) tracking a ground target, my experiments all crashed together, and I soon realized that I could no longer log in to my computer. 

<p>
Shortly thereafter, I received a phone call from my advisor stating that the chair of the department wanted to speak with me. I was in deep trouble.

<p>
Normally, our department was very supportive of its students. And it was of me until this sudden change. After receiving the call from my advisor I met with the department chair. He told me that I had sent an email to a professor of mathematics asking him to read a paper I had written.

<p>
Yes, I had done so. In fact, I had asked many professors of mathematics to do that same thing. This was my crime, asking professors to listen to what I had to say and to tell me what they thought about it. One month earlier my advisor had told me that I must stop, and I had told him that I would not. 

<p>
It was not easy for me to refuse to comply with my advisor's demand. I did so for deeply personal reasons. 

<p>
His demand was not the first such demand. On April 15th I had received an unsettling email from someone I had not contacted who essentially demanded that I stop contacting math professors. He wrote:

<blockquote>
"Please consider carefully the following bit of personal advice.   There are two possibilities.

<p>
(1) Your proof is wrong,  or (2) Your proof is right.   If your proof is right,  you'll be famous and successful.   If your proof is wrong,  you will be embarrassed and you will have difficulty getting a job. If your proof is right,  you have plenty of time and the stated results are inevitable when your proof is recognized.  If your proof is wrong,  the fewer people know about it the better. For example, many people have embarrassed themselves by prematurely making public their wrong proofs of P != NP or P=NP.  I can remember the names of some of them,  perhaps you can also.   Many others have also had wrong proofs of P != NP but had the good sense to show them only to one other person, or to zero other persons.  Luckily for them,  nobody knows how many of them there are.

<p>
It is very easy to make mistakes in mathematics.  I will not try to convince you that you have made mathematical mistakes--that should be the job of your professors.  You should not have made your proof public without convincing your Ph. D. advisor of its correctness.  For the sake of your future career,  you should now cease sending out your proof,  remove it from any public website, and discuss the proof with one professor until either you see that it is wrong or you convince the professor it is right."
</blockquote>

<p>
I wrote back later that day:

<blockquote>
"Thank you for the very thoughtful email. I will carefully consider it carefully. Up to this point, I have chosen a different strategy.

<p>
I don't think it would be a great embarrassment to me if someone identified a flaw in my arguments. Isn't that what academics is all about, learning? Or is the purpose of academic research to build a reputation?

<p>
From the point of view of learning, the more people who consider my arguments the better. If the arguments are correct, then people will learn. If they are not correct, then people will learn why. 

<p>
If my arguments are not correct, the more people who look at my paper, the higher the likelihood that someone will identify a flaw. I am willing for people to know that I make mistakes. I am also willing for people to know that I wrote the paper.

<p>
If my arguments are correct, then people will want to know sooner rather than later. If I have not made a mistake, then others have made mistakes. But isn't that OK as long as we learn from them?"
</blockquote>

<p>
The proof referred to in the above email is <a href="doc/not-zfc.pdf">A proof of the inconsistency of ZFC</a>. On March 2nd I had submitted the paper to Philip Welch, for potential publication in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.   

<p>
Conversations with several leading authorities in mathematics had not convinced me of any substantive error in my paper, but did help me better understand prevailing thought and attitudes.

<p>
I remained true to my personal convictions, at a cost. If at some future time my sacrifice proves fruitful, I will be grateful. At present, I will be patient. I take solace knowing that I was true to myself, and to my God. 

<p>
I never did regain access to my computer, or to the cluster of computers in the lab of which it was a part. It was a very useful cluster. Also, I felt a connection to it since I had helped to bring in money to fund it, and had participated in its design and assembly. I missed my computer, but not only that. 

<p>
What was worse than not being able to use my computer was not being able to sit at my desk in the lab where I had close contact with my advisor.  

<p>
I continued to work towards completing my degree. My advisor continued to work with me, in spite of the fact that our relationship had been strained. I found a different place on campus to work, and other computing clusters. 

<p>
Eventually my advisor stopped working with me. On November 1st 2016 I sent him a draft of a paper I had been working on for about a year. He read it and four days later sent me an email saying that I had done good work, which I was very excited to hear. He mentioned a few minor problems, and said that he would give me more feedback. I never heard from him about the paper again. After losing the support of my advisor, progress towards completing my degree was halted.

<p>
I later learned that I had been dropped from my program of study on November 15th (2016), because I had refused to commit to not talk with math professors.

<p>
My story would be incomplete without an account of the role that my faith in God has played, and continues to play. My faith is an integral part of my life and is especially relevant to my ZFC paper and the story behind it.

<p>
I was born in England. My father is English and my mother American, Croatian by lineage. I was raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I have one brother and one sister. I am the oldest and we are about seven years apart.

<p>
While I was growing up we lived in four different homes, Lawndale, Curdes, Parker Drive, and Ravinia. My favorite was the home on Parker Drive. Parker Drive was a long winding gravel road alongside a river. Our home was on about 4 acres, with a barn and two Shetland ponies. The area for the ponies was surrounded by an electric fence.

<p>
My brother Colin and I had the basement to ourselves. It was mostly one large room with a hard concrete floor. One of my favorite memories was making little bomb shelters out of legos, taking them to the top of the basement stairs and then throwing them to the basement floor. The objective was to see if we could build a structure which could withstand the impact.

<p>
We lived in a kids paradise. I doubt that it was a parents paradise. I remember an extended period of time when the well didn't work. During that time we drove to a nearby business to fill large containers with water.   

<p>
During the blizzard of '78 the city shut down for three days. School shut down for a week. I decided to use that time to hone my fire-making skills.  

<p>
My church sponsored a Boy Scout troop. We went on a 50-mile afoot afloat adventure. We canoed for days, drinking in the beauty of the river and engaging the other canoes in battle. At night I was eaten alive by mosquitoes, but that discomfort didn't begin to dampen my enthusiasm.

<p>
One family vacation we stayed for a week in an old cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky. Before we could use the cabin, spider webs and other traces of animals had to be cleaned out. Mom brought beautiful quilts from home for the beds and cooked on an old wood stove in the center of the cabin.

<p>
I played endless board games with Dad. The aim of my existence that week was to beat him, but I never did. At one point I broke down and cried after losing a game I had so hoped to win. He didn't like seeing me hurt and asked if he should let me win. I choked down my tears and said something like "No Dad, it's OK. I don't want you to let me win."

<p>
I delivered newspapers to a nearby apartment complex. I enjoyed delivering the papers. It was good exercise and I felt good about learning to work. I didn't like collecting money from my customers. I collected enough to pay my bill to the newspaper company and a little extra for myself, but there were many people who got a free newspaper.

<p>
I attended early morning seminary which helped me to learn and appreciate the scriptures. I felt the love and faith of my teachers, and I grew to love them.

<p>
I played the trumpet in jazz and marching bands. We traveled to Daytona Beach in Florida. The rising sun on the ocean was spectacular.

<p>
I remember my teachers Mr. Beights, Mrs. Szink, Mr. Wittenberg, Mr. Dvorak, Mr. Ashton and Mrs. Thomson. They instilled within me a love for learning and a confidence in my ability to succeed in life. 

<p>
I did enjoy high school, but when I finished I felt free. Free to pursue a life of challenge and achievement.

<p>
Both of my parents had gone to BYU. That's how they met. It made perfect sense. I'd go to BYU too, find a beautiful girl, and marry in the temple for time and all eternity. I'd be a dad, gain experience, and learn to become like my Heavenly Father. So off I went, across the country to a parched land with no trees, no mosquitoes, and beckoning mountains.

<p>
It was difficult to be a responsible adult. I was just starting out, and learning important lessons through hard experience. Surprisingly, my grades were only average. More was being expected of me, and I began to realize that I had wasted opportunity in high school due to my poor attitude toward studying.  

<p>
I found some awesome friends. We had a great time together.

<p>
I received my patriarcal blessing from Clyde Sandgren, which inspired me with a powerful vision of what I could become by following the gospel plan.

<p>
My boyish heart was broken. My friends patiently listened. Time helped cheer me up.

<p>
At the end of the academic year, it was time to return home to Indiana. The first order of business was to earn money for a mission. I got hired by a landscaping company, but couldn't actually work for the first two weeks due to heavy rain. But I was determined to work. So I decided to start a television repair business, to pursue when I wasn't landscaping.

<p>
Mostly I just replaced worn out vacuum tubes, but there were other problems. One in particular stumped me. The main fuse was blown. After replacing it, the new fuse blew immediately. I had no training in electronics, and no idea what I was doing, so I decided to wrap the blown fuse in tin foil. KA-POW! That was exciting, and distressing. Obviously there had been something else wrong, causing the fuse to blow. Unfortunately, the TV was now dead as a doornail.

<p>
After a year and a half I didn't have much money for a mission. I had some expensive TV repair equipment, which I planned to use afterwards. My father realized what was happening and decided to charge me a little each month for rent. Without saying anything, he saved that money for me. When it was time to serve the Lord as a missionary, my dad let me know what he had done. I would have enough.

<p>
I received a call to serve in the Germany Hamburg mission, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As part of my preparation I returned to Utah and received my endowment in the Salt Lake temple. 

<p>
My mission transformed my life. That miracle unfolded through service, service to the Lord and to my neighbor. It was a difficult form of service, difficult to give because it wasn't welcomed. I became a new person because of it, less selfish and more dedicated to the Lord. 

<p>
Rather than share details of my mission in Germany, I'd like to share a scripture. "And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!" (Doctrine and Covenants 18:15)

<p>
Following my mission I returned to BYU. I was a new person, but still far from perfect. I would describe this period of my life as a bit painful. I am grateful for the influence of friends from my mission who continued that friendship afterwards. One of those friends and I ran the Saint George marathon together. That was fun.

<p>
I was blessed to marry a bright beautiful girl, my best friend. Together, we were blessed with Devon, Joshua, Lauresa, Brian, Christopher, Adam, Amelia, Samuel, Alison, John, and Michelle. And the blessings continue to come as our children marry and have children of their own. Truly the windows of heaven have been opened and blessings poured out upon us.

<p>
While in school, I taught German at the missionary training center and took care of equipment in the electrical engineering shop.   

<p>
Around the time I graduated in computer and electrical engineering, I decided to venture off on my own. I wanted independence and adventure. There was so much I looked forward to doing and learning. I was brimming with enthusiasm and self-confidence.

<p>
One of my ambitions was to use computers to help people learn foreign languages, particularly to help with listening comprehension and pronunciation.

<p>
Most computers at the time lacked sound capabilities. For my senior project I designed and built a sound card together with amplified speaker and enclosure for the IBM PC. 

<p>
My plan was to start by repairing electronics, and then use my spare time to branch out into other areas, such as developing educational software and whatever else I wanted to do. So I set up shop in our apartment and went to work.

<p>
My business specialized in computer monitor repair. When a monitor stopped working, I would find the diode, capacitor, or other component that had failed and replace it. Often the problem was a bad solder joint. The cost in materials to fix a monitor was generally very low. The challenge was to quickly find the faulty component, or components. 

<p>
I learned that time was better spent when I actually understood how a circuit worked. I rarely had a schematic diagram to help. Rather, I studied the layout of the circuit board. This practice of learning how a circuit worked by studying the layout of the board was fairly practical since circuit boards were almost always single-sided.

<p>
 If I didn't find the root cause of a problem at first, I would need to go back and take a closer look until I found the culprit perpetuating the problem.  

<p>
My family was growing, my business was marginal, spare time was scarce, and money was tight. I began to realize my limitations. Instead of being buoyed up with anticipation for the future I began to be weighed down with failings of the past.  

<p>
Obviously, things weren't going as planned. At that time I had two small repair shops, one in Provo and the other in Auburn Washington. I thought it would be best to leave my business and join the growing software development market back in Utah.

<p>
Before making a final decision I counseled with the Lord through fasting and prayer. 

<p>
Earlier, before starting my business I had done the same. At that time I really wanted to start my own business and essentially asked the Lord for permission. The answer I received was that it would be fine with Him, as long I as lived righteously and kept His commandments. So, I enthusiastically started my business.

<p>
This time was very different. I asked for counsel regarding my plans to change course. The answer I received was that it would be better for me to stay with my business and discipline myself to run it effectively. I was counseled to pay closer attention to detail and to start work consistently by 8am.

<p>
So I stayed with my business and put my effort into doing a better job. 

<p>
I tried working more. I put more burden on my sweetheart at home. I was negligent fulfilling my responsibilities at church. As scoutmaster, I chose not to go with my troop to summer camp. Though, I did not work on Sunday. Finally, I realized that working too little was not the problem.  

<p>
I tried working smarter, and saw limited success. Gradually, I was doing a better job. 

<p>
And I was growing in other ways. I was asked to serve as scoutmaster again, this time back in Utah. Smarting from earlier poor choices, I decided to serve wholeheartedly and felt great about it. My troop helped build Discovery Park in Pleasant Grove.

<p>
But in spite of improvements my business was a dead end. I could not find a way to get a decent return on the investment of time required to diagnose a failure. There were too many different failures. There were too few monitors with the same failure. And, the cost of a new monitor was steadily falling.  

<p>
I had tried many times to start work consistently by 8am, but had not actually done it. About seven years had passed, since I received that counsel from the Lord. I knew that starting work early was important, but did not think it was going to solve all my problems. 

<p>
One Sunday while sitting in church partaking of the sacrament I promised the Lord I would do what He had counseled me to do. I realized that I had been trying harder to do my best than to follow His counsel. During the next few years I wrestled to keep that promise, and eventually did. Keeping my promise to God meant everything to me.

<p>
I learned that it was more important for me to listen to my Heavenly Father than to succeed, more important even than to succeed in doing something good. I realized that by choosing to follow His counsel I had embarked on a spiritual journey to a land which could only be reached with His continued help and direction.

<p>
From the moment I made that promise I was filled with a profound sense of peace and happiness. The Spirit of the Lord whispered to my soul that God was pleased.  

<p>
While fixing monitors I didn't have any free time on my hands, not free time for my hands. My hands were always busy. There were things to take apart, to put back together, to solder, and to un-solder. 

<p>
But my mind had free time. The challenge was how to take advantage of that opportunity. I wanted to learn Java. I figured that I needed to read the language specification. There were other things I also needed to read, such as the scriptures and teachings of the presidents of the church.

<p>
So I wrote a program to read these things to me aloud, while I worked.

<p>
My mind had free time, but that time was frequently interrupted. The phone would ring. A customer would come in. I would finish what I was doing. Another challenge was understanding the output of text-to-speech software. Some words were pronounced incorrectly. The output was unnatural, lacking the natural flow of speech which helps the listener understand. 

<p>
So I wrote the program to read aloud only one line of text at a time, then wait for input from me. That way, I could take a phone call, help a customer, or think about what needed to be done without having to pause the computer. Also, if I had trouble understanding what was said, I could easily have the computer say it again. 

<p>
I came to really like the fact that the computer waited for input before continuing. Perhaps what I liked most was that I could easily think about what I had just heard. My pondering was not interrupted by the computer. Reading continued only when I was ready. Reading by listening in this way was more like regular reading, which only continued when I took initiative by moving my eyes to the next line of text.

<p>
I had the idea that the program I had written for reading could be modified to act as an audio computer interface, enabling a person to use a computer without a visual interface. I thought an audio interface might be useful to people who were driving or otherwise unable to look at a visual interface. I loved to hike and think. Perhaps I would enjoy having computer access without the necessity of stopping to look at a screen, or trying to view a screen while walking. 

<p>
I realized that a simple touch-tone telephone had the necessary electronics to implement a basic audio interface: a network connection, a speaker, and some buttons. And it had a microphone.  

<p>
I decided to pursue my audio interface idea by building a prototype. I figured that writing the necessary software would either help me start a new business or help me start a new career.  

<p>
So I built a prototype using a Dialogic telephone interface computer expansion board. The basic functionality was that a user could peruse a set of choices by going forward and backward through a list of audio messages, and then initiate an action by selecting the desired choice. The telephone keypad acted essentially as a computer mouse, and the telephone speaker acted as the display. 

<p>
A friend helped me find a market for the invention, which I pursued. A local movie theater decided to use the system, dubbed Keypad Browser, to announce movie showtimes over the phone. The system allowed users to quickly find showtimes they wanted to hear rather than having to wade through one long message. My dad and brother-in-law encouraged me to file a patent. I wrote it, and my dad paid the filing fee. 

<p>
At this point my monitor repair business had dried up. I took some odd jobs, including delivering newspapers with the help of my oldest children. My brother offered me a job at a computer hardware startup which was being acquired by Avocent, and I took it gratefully. Cinemark, a movie theater chain, expressed interest in my product and asked me to send them one for a new theater opening in American Fork.

<p>
During the next two years I got a taste of working for a large business, which I thoroughly enjoyed after being on my own for so many years. It was great to work together as a team to try to bring a product to market. My ability to diagnose difficult problems came in handy several times. 

<p>
During that same period, Cinemark bought many of my movie showtime announcement systems, and I successfully defended my patent claims with the help of a law firm.

<p>
Suzanne and I focused on paying off debts. We felt extremely blessed. We had just finished paying off everything except the mortgage when news came that my employer was shutting down its branch in Utah. 

<p>
Our house was small and brimming with children. We had a large back yard for kids to play and Mom to garden. We grew tomatoes, peppers, green beans, corn, onions, raspberries, apples, peaches, and a few potatoes. We tried to grow apricots and pears, but without much success. Each fall we canned enough salsa to last a year, around 60 quarts. We also made our own bread, as much as 16 loaves every two weeks from freshly ground whole wheat.

<p>
There were plenty of opportunities to develop Christ-like attributes, such as patience and brotherly kindness, especially with seven brothers in the house! We shared one bathroom.

<p>
In the winter I split logs for the wood stove. It was big and put out a lot of heat. The house was poorly insulated. The wood stove helped keep down the heating bill and made at least one room very warm. The light from the fire cheered Mom's spirits when winter gloom blocked out the sun for extended periods.

<p>
Mom instilled a love for reading and music in each child. She regularly took them to the library and read to them. She kept an eye open for a good used book at the local thrift store. We limited time for media in our home so that there would be plenty of time for homework, reading, singing, and visiting together. She taught each of our children to play the piano. The sound of music filled our home. 

<p>
Mom cut everyone's hair, except her own. 

<p>
After a long day of hard work, Mom would settle down and enjoy reading for herself. We loved her, and she loved us. We tried to be good and helpful so she would not follow through on her repeated threat to run away to Mexico.

<p>
My wife helped me to see that I needed to change the way I treated my oldest son. The Spirit of the Lord softened my heart and helped me humble myself sufficient to listen and understand the truth of what she said. 

<p>
Things were going great! Then in November 2005, my company decided to close its newly acquired Utah location. With that closure came a career decision for me. I enjoyed my work there, but was not excited about relocating to Alabama or pursuing a similar type of work with some other company. I felt I needed to pay attention to my career, not just to getting another job.

<p>
I was inspired by the thought of people benefiting from the system for reading by listening which I had discovered. My Keypad Browser audio computer interface technology could help provide such a benefit. Up to this point in time, the technology was merely being used to provide efficient telephone access to movie showtimes. Its full potential had not yet been realized. I thought perhaps it was possible to build a business on Keypad Browser technology. I attempted to put together a team and a business plan. I studied marketing and participated in the Utah Valley Entrepreneurial Forum.

<p>
In August 2006, I received a church calling which included a speaking assignment in front of over a hundred people, almost every month. Oddly, I wasn't afraid to speak in front of so many people. However at first, I was almost incapable of preparing a coherent talk. I found it extremely difficult to decide what to say, and how to say it. I stayed up all night trying to prepare for my first speaking assignment, making almost no progress. I was fried going to the meeting, and totally unprepared. Lucky for the congregation, most of them were residents of a care center who had difficulty hearing or understanding what I said. 

<p>
By January 2007, with the help of friends, I learned that it was not practical for me to build a career by building a business. I needed a different career plan. While out for a run, I had a strong spiritual impression that it was time for me to run as fast as I could, and that doing so involved serious risk.  

<p>
I contacted TellMe, the company which had won what used to be my Cinemark business and told them about Keypad Browser technology, and how it might help them. Perhaps they would be interested in licensing my patent, or working with me in some way. 

<p>
I flew to California to pitch my ideas. That trip did not appear successful. Yet, it was another spiritual turning point in my life. I felt that God was especially close. I felt that He was interested in me, and in my concerns.

<p>
On the morning of March 1st 2007, during my prayer to begin the day I received the clear instruction: Go to BYU. I acted in faith and came to understand that the Lord wanted me to set my sights on a PhD, and consider the possibility of being a university professor. 

<p>
I found a friend in Deryle Lonsdale, a professor at BYU who was actively involved in computational linguistics research. He invited me to participate in his PSST (Pedagogical Software and Speech Technology) research group. I began attending meetings and trying to learn.

<p>
I thought I might use what I learned to improve my reading by listening system. Perhaps I could figure out a way to automatically detect paragraph boundaries in speech, to break up speech into small segments, or ideas, which then could be listened to thoughtfully, one at a time. 

<p>
I searched the Harold B. Lee library and found a periodical named Computational Linguistics. I started skimming articles to try to get a feel for the field. Mostly, I understood very little. But, I did start to get interested in some questions.

<p>
Dr. Lonsdale introduced me to a professor in the computer science department who also was interested in computational linguistics, Eric Ringger. Thanks to both of their kindness, I continued to learn and progress. 

<p>
Dr. Ringger invited me to sit in on his statistical natural language processing course. I was totally fascinated! After the end of the course, I asked if I could sit in on another. He let me know that I needed to enroll as a student. 

<p>
So, I applied to the Master's degree program in computer science with Dr. Ringer as my advisor, and miraculously was accepted. I was SO excited. I was embarking on a new career, belatedly but finally where I belonged.  

<p>
Upon entering the program in the Fall of 2008, I took a part-time job grading papers for another professor in the Computer Science department, Kevin Seppi. I thought it was pathetic that I was working for so little money, but I was grateful for the employment and for the opportunity to learn more about the work of education.

<p>
My first experience trying to publish was with Dr. Lonsdale and another member of the PSST research group, Jeremiah McGhee. We pursued the idea of predicting scores in oral language proficiency interviews, using scores from a fully automated sentence repetition test. People learning English were tested in both ways, in an oral interview, and using an automated system. The automated system played a recording of an English sentence, recorded the test-takers attempt to repeat the sentence, and then scored the attempt. The automated test was not nearly as comprehensive a test as the interview, but it was much less expensive. We found that we were able to use the automated test to predict interview scores, to some degree.

<p>
Our first attempt to publish was a last minute affair, staying up late into the night to write a first and final draft. Our results were promising, but I was not at all confident in my ability to write. That first submission was rejected. Among other reasons, we had not cited an important related work.

<p>
Over the following year and a half, two revisions of that first paper were submitted and subsequently rejected. Dr. Lonsdale had kind of given up on the paper. But in April 2011, two years after our original attempt, we succeeded! This success was a big confidence booster, for me. The experience helped me to learn about the whole process of researching a question of interest to others in a global conversation of ideas, designing and running experiments, analyzing results, and writing to contribute to the conversation. I learned a lot about writing. I learned to express myself so that others could understand what I wanted to communicate.     

<p>
While working on my oral proficiency paper, I also worked on my thesis. I had participated in research groups with both Dr. Lonsdale and Dr. Ringger. Dr. Ringger's group was studying spoken language identification, automatically determining which of several common languages of the world is being spoken in recorded speech. I decided to address the language identification problem for my Master's thesis. I became interested in understanding what was required to obtain an arbitrarily high correct classification rate. 

<p>
Initially, I worked with spoken language. One popular method for identifying language was strongly influenced by commonly spoken words. I wanted to be able to recognize a language even when the words spoken were not common.  

<p>
On July 13th 2009 I recorded: "I went to the temple Saturday and received some guidance regarding a model to generate language. My language model can contain my training data, all in order. I can generate language by reproducing the training data, all in order. This would represent the highest level of correlation with the data. Lower levels of correlation could be obtained by introducing discontinuities. If a generated sequence only has one discontinuity, that means that it can be divided once, to form two sequences, both of which are sub-sequences of the data. A measure of similarity to the language would be the approximate number of discontinuities in a sequence divided by the length of the sequence."

<p>
That idea came to me in the temple. The Lord helped me in my research. He has helped me all along throughout my life, though much of His help has come by way of letting me struggle, without providing the specific help I thought I needed.

<p>
The idea consisted of generating language by concatenating segments of the training data. The average length of the segments could be used as a similarity measure, similarity of the generated language to the language of the training data.

<p>
To illustrate, training data might be a newspaper. A segment might be a sequence of characters from the newspaper, such as part of a word, a whole word, part of a sentence, and so forth. Suppose that the newspaper contains "the dog barked so loudly that". Now suppose that I want to determine if the sequence of characters "the dogs barked" belongs to the same language as the newspaper. I could generate that sequence by concatenating segments found in the newspaper: "the dog", "s", and " barked". The average length of these segments is 5 characters, which could be used to measure similarity between "the dogs barked" and the newspaper.  

<p>                   
Prevailing measures of similarity gave high scores to sequences containing segments which occur often in the training data, while this measure ignored the popularity of segments and only considered their length. I hoped to show that this measure would prove useful for estimating the probability that a sequence belonged to a language. 

<p>                   
The basic innovation I proposed was not specific to spoken language. I figured it could be applied to either spoken or written language, text. If the innovation had value, I should be able to demonstrate that value using text. It would be much easier to run experiments with text, rather than with audio. Also, the field of text classification was more general and widely studied than the field of spoken language identification. So, I decided to first try to validate my ideas using standard text classification tasks. 

<p> 
By the end of the year, 2009, I had some positive experimental results, something Dr. Ringger kept reminding me I needed to have!

<p> 
Dr. Ringger worked with Hal Daume from the University of Utah to organize an NLP (Natural Language Processing) Fest for their students, to be held at the end of February (2010). In preparation for this fest, he invited his students to present their research to each other. I struggled to prepare my practice presentation. On Wednesday, February 3rd, I wrote: "Yesterday I presented a preliminary version of my thesis proposal to the NLP lab. It went very well. I was working on it on Monday, but was struggling a lot and not making much progress. It is important for me to remember to call upon the Lord in all of my concerns. I did that, and the next day I was able to make much better progress. I felt that it would be a good idea to fast because I was presenting that day. So I did. While fasting, I was reminded that I could fast when I needed help with something especially difficult for me. I will remember to do that in the future."

<p> 
In retrospect, I would like to share a scripture from the Book of Mormon. I don't remember if this specific scripture came to mind when I had that experience, but it most likely did. The verse is Alma 34:20 "Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks." I had come to understand that is was OK to ask God for His help with things like my work, things which one might not think would rise to the level of Divine concern. Yet at the same time I found myself forgetting the principle, repeatedly trying to do too much on my own. I was trying to do a lot. I was married. We had eleven children. Our youngest was not yet three years old. Suzanne and I both actively served in our church. We tried to be good neighbors. 

<p> 
I did receive much help from Heaven, particularly that month. I had several key insights into my research. I realized that the fewest possible number of segments from training data which could be concatenated to generate a sequence was generally the most likely number of segments to have randomly been drawn (to generate the sequence according to my model), and that it was possible to determine that number very efficiently. Dr. Ringger told me about a certain type of data structure called a suffix trie, which could help to calculate the number. 

<p> 
By this point in time, I had essentially completed the required course work for my Master's degree. I got so much out of those courses! I especially enjoyed the course on Bayesian methods I took from Dr. Seppi.

<p> 
And by this same time I was finally making good progress towards writing the required thesis. If my goal was to earn a Master's degree, I should have been close to finishing. But my goal was to earn a doctoral degree. That is what I had felt so strongly that I should try to do, before going back to school. 

<p> 
In my letter of intent, as part of applying to the Master's program, I wrote that I intended to continue on to complete a doctoral degree.

<p> 
In May of 2009 I had asked Dr. Ringger if he would be my PhD advisor. I understood that I would need someone willing to be my advisor in order to be accepted into the doctoral program. He had told me that doing so would be a big commitment for him. His initial answer was no, but it might change if I did good work later on my thesis.

<p> 
On January 26, 2010, I recorded in my journal an impression I had received, that I should plan to switch advisors from Dr. Ringger to Dr. Seppi. 

<p> 
On March 9th I talked again with Dr. Ringger about being my PhD advisor. I thought I had made good progress on my thesis and that he might be willing to change his mind. He was not willing at that time.

<p> 
Remembering that I had received an impression that Dr. Seppi would be a great PhD advisor for me, I asked him the following day. He didn't say yes, or no. I had no assurance that he would later agree to my request, except for the spiritual impression I had received.

<p> 
On April 9th I recorded: "I have decided to ask Dr. Seppi to be my adviser now, rather than later. Dr. Ringger has been very helpful to me in the progress which I have made to this point. It is now time for me to begin working with my future PhD adviser."

<p>
A few days later I told Dr. Ringger about asking Dr. Seppi to be my advisor. 

<p>
Dr. Lonsdale, Dr. Ringger, and Dr. Seppi were not the only ones who greatly influenced my experience in graduate school. So also did my fellow students. One experience is particularly memorable. I didn't record anything about it at the time, so I don't know when it happened. My guess is that it occurred in the Fall of 2009.

<p>
One day in the NLP lab I made an off-hand joke about evolution. (I used to do that sort of thing because the idea of our beautiful world being created by chance struck me as funny.) I do not remember what I said, but the response surprised me. The response was that my lab partners did not think my joke was very funny. One of them said that the evidence that man evolved was overwhelming. I do not think I responded. I had no idea what to say. 

<p>
This experience had a great impact upon me. I felt that something was terribly wrong. I felt a need to do something to help. I wondered why God had lead me back to BYU. Originally, I thought that He was helping me to establish myself in a career that would be right for me. Now, I wondered if there was some special service He wanted me to perform. My patriarchal blessing, received while attending BYU as a young man, gave me knowledge about future responsibilities the Lord would have me fulfill. I thought about that blessing and how it related to this experience.
