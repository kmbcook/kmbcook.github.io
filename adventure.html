  <h2>The Adventures of Kevin Cook</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the story of my adventures in graduate school. I was a doctoral student in computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah.

<p>
On Thursday June 4th 2015 at about 11am while running multiple experiments simulating a team of UAVs tracking a ground target, my experiments all crashed together, and I soon realized that I could no longer log in to my computer. 

<p>
Shortly thereafter, I received a phone call from my advisor stating that the chair of the department wanted to speak with me. I was in deep trouble.

<p>
Normally, our department was very supportive of its students. And it was of me until this sudden change. After receiving the call from my advisor I met with the department chair. He told me that I had sent an email to a professor of mathematics asking him to read a paper I had written.

<p>
Yes, I had done so. In fact, I had asked many professors of mathematics to do that same thing. This was my crime, asking professors to listen to what I had to say and to tell me what they thought about it. One month earlier my advisor had told me that I must stop, and I had told him that I would not. 

<p>
I never did regain access to my computer, or the cluster of computers in the lab of which it was a part. It was a very useful cluster. Also, I felt a connection to it since I had helped to bring in money to fund it, and had participated in its design and assembly. I missed my computer, but not only that. 

<p>
What was worse than not being able to use my computer was not being able to sit at my desk in the lab where I had close contact with my advisor.  

<p>
I continued to work towards completing my degree. My advisor continued to work with me, in spite of the fact that our relationship had been strained. I found a different place on campus to work, and other computing clusters. 

<p>
Eventually my advisor stopped working with me. On November 1st 2016 I sent him a draft of a paper I had been working on for about a year. He read it and four days later sent me an email saying that I had done good work, which I was very excited to hear. He mentioned a few minor problems, and said that he would give me more feedback. I never heard from him about the paper again. After losing the support of my advisor, progress towards completing my degree was halted.
