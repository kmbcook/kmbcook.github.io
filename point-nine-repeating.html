  <h2>Does 0.999... equal one?</h2>

<p>
The number 0.9 does not equal one. And the number 0.99 does not equal one. No matter how many times we add another nine, the resulting number still does not equal one.

<p>
The question "Does 0.999... equal one?" is confusing since the term "0.999..." implies that the nines repeat without end, making it impossible to get to the word "equal" when trying to make sense of the question.

<p>
In order to make sense of the question, it is necessary to define the term "0.999...". 

<h3>Limit</h3>
<p>
If we define the term to be equivalent to one, then yes it equals one. Such is the case when we define the term to be equal to the limit of a variable which approaches one as nines are added. Defining the term to be equal to the limit of this variable is confusing. If the term refers to the limit of the variable, then what notation is used to refer to the variable itself? The limit equals one. When referring to the limit, why not just use the term "one"?

<h3>Variable</h3>
<p>
If we define the term as a variable which approaches one as nines are added, then no it does not equal one since it does not refer to the same number at any time. Rather, it refers to a different number each time a nine is added.

<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>
One might attempt to define the term as a zero followed by a decimal point followed by an infinite sequence of nines, not a sequence which is continually growing, but a static sequence which has no end. Such an attempt to define would be contradictory since specifying the end of a static sequence is necessary in order to define the sequence. 

<p>
In order to define a static sequence it is necessary to define both the beginning and the end of the sequence. For example, suppose that the first element of a sequence is nine, the second element is nine, and likewise the third element is nine. Has the sequence been defined? Not yet. If we additionally specify that the third element is the last element, then the sequence is defined. Once the sequence is defined we can interpret the sequence as a number, 999.

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>
A zero followed by a decimal point followed by an unlimited (in a sense infinite) number of nines may define a class, rather than refer to the contradiction above. The sequences 0.9, 0.99, and 0.999 are all members of this class, meaning that each of these sequences satisfy the constraints of the class. The class itself is a description, not a sequence or a group of sequences.  

<h3>Convention</h3>
The academic convention today is to consider 0.999... an infinite sequence, not the variable or class described above, rather the contradiction described above without acknowledging that the choice is contradictory. Such a choice is confusing and harmful.

<h3>Proposal</h3>
I propose changing convention in favor of terminology which clarifies meaning.
