  <h2>Does 0.999... equal one?</h2>

<p>
The number 0.9 does not equal one. And the number 0.99 does not equal one. No matter how many times we add another nine, the resulting number still does not equal one.

<p>
The question "Does 0.999... equal one?" is confusing since the term "0.999..." implies that the nines repeat without end, making it impossible to get to the word "equal" when trying to make sense of the question.

<p>
In order to make sense of the question, it is necessary to define the term "0.999...". 

<h3>Variable</h3>
<p>
If we define the term as a variable which approaches one as nines are added, then no it does not equal one since it does not refer to the same number at any time. Rather, it refers to a different number each time a nine is added.

<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>
One might attempt to define the term as a zero followed by a decimal point followed by an infinite sequence of nines, not a sequence which is continually growing, but a static sequence which has no end. Such an attempt to define would be contradictory since specifying the end of a static sequence is necessary in order to define the sequence. 

<p>
In order to define a static sequence it is necessary to define both the beginning and the end of the sequence. For example, suppose that the first element of a sequence is nine, the second element is nine, and likewise the third element is nine. Has the sequence been defined? Not yet. If we additionally specify that the third element is the last element, then the sequence is defined. Once the sequence is defined we can interpret the sequence as a number, 999.

<p>
I reject the practice of defining the term sequence as referring to something which does not have an end, because the sequence of digits 999 has an end, and is a sequence.

<h3>Class</h3>
<p>
A zero followed by a decimal point followed by an unlimited (in a sense infinite) number of nines may define a class, rather than refer to the contradiction above. The sequences 0.9, 0.99, and 0.999 are all members of this class, meaning that each of these sequences satisfy the constraints of the class. The class itself is a description, not a sequence or a collection of sequences. 

<p>
There is no limit to the number of sequences belonging to this class. Therefore it is not possible for any collection of sequences, which collection has been completely defined sometime in the past, to contain all sequences belonging to the class. Here, the phrase "all sequences belonging to the class" does not refer to a collection of sequences. Rather than referring to sequences collectively, it refers to them separately.

<p>
The meaning of a description can change depending on whether or not the description refers to individuals separately or collectively. Consider the description: "a single sequence, of length one or two nines". What does this description, or class, refer to? Which sequences are members of this class? The answer depends upon the answer to another question: does the description refer to sequences separately or collectively? If the description refers to sequences separately, then both 9 and 99 are members of the class, since both sequences satisfy the description. However, if the description refers to sequences collectively then either 9 or 99 are members of the class, but not both, since the description specifies that the collection contains a single sequence.

<p>
Using the term "all" to refer to members of any class with unlimited membership necessarily must refer to members separately, not collectively. Using the term "any" clarifies that members are referred to separately. For example, "any sequence belonging to the class" refers to members separately. 

<h3>Limit</h3>
<p>
One might define the term to refer to the limit of the variable described above. Since the limit is one, the term would refer to one. To avoid confusion it would be necessary to define a term referring to the variable.

<p>
Rather than define the term to refer directly to the limit, one might consider defining the term to evaluate to the limit. If the term refers to the variable described above then the term does not evaluate to the limit, because the variable refers to a different number each time a nine is added. If the term refers to the contradiction described above then the term does not evaluate to anything. If the term refers to the class described above then again the term does not evaluate since it is a description not a sequence. In order to pursue this course it would be necessary to specify what the term refers to while ensuring that what the term refers to can evaluate to one.
